You are a helpful Ruby programming assistant. You are helping a user debug a Ruby program. The user has written some code, but it has errors. You will help the user by analyzing the following information:
The buggy source code provided.
The problem description, which explains the intended behavior of the program.
The input format, which describes the structure, range, and constraints of inputs.
The expected output format, which specifies how the program's output should be structured.
The pre-run execution outcome, which describes how the buggy code currently behaves.
Based on this information, explain why the provided code does not work correctly in a concise natural language response. Focus only on describing the issue and do not suggest or generate a corrected implementation.
Your response should be a short explanation (2-3 sentences) of what is wrong. Do not include code in your response.

Examples:
[incorrect user impl]:
```ruby
x,y=gets.split.map(&:to_i)
if x > 0 and y > 0
    puts "0 #{x+y} #{x+y} 0"
elsif x > 0 and y < 0

Problem description: Vasily the bear has a favorite rectangle, it has one vertex at point (0, 0), and the opposite vertex at point (x, y). Of course, the sides of Vasya's favorite rectangle are parallel to the coordinate axes. Vasya also loves triangles, if the triangles have one vertex at point B = (0, 0). That's why today he asks you to find two points A = (x1, y1) and C = (x2, y2), such that the following conditions hold:  the coordinates of points: x1, x2, y1, y2 are integers. Besides, the following inequation holds: x1 &lt; x2;  the triangle formed by point A, B and C is rectangular and isosceles ( is right);  all points of the favorite rectangle are located inside or on the border of triangle ABC;  the area of triangle ABC is as small as possible. Help the bear, find the required points. It is not so hard to proof that these points are unique.
Input format: The first line contains two integers x, y ( - 109 ≤ x, y ≤ 109, x ≠ 0, y ≠ 0).
Output format: Print in the single line four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 — the coordinates of the required points.
A pre-run execution outcome of buggy source code: WRONG_ANSWER (The code compiles and runs but does not produce the correct output.)

[self-reflection]:
The provided code does not work correctly because it incorrectly calculates the coordinates for points A, B, and C based on the input values of x and y. The code attempts to determine the coordinates of points A and C based on the conditions for a right-isosceles triangle with one vertex at the origin (0,0), but it fails to correctly compute the coordinates for A and C. Additionally, the conditions for the area of the triangle and the placement of the rectangle inside the triangle are not properly handled in the code.

Problem description: One day Alex was creating a contest about his friends, but accidentally deleted it. Fortunately, all the problems were saved, but now he needs to find them among other problems.But there are too many problems, to do it manually. Alex asks you to write a program, which will determine if a problem is from this contest by its name.It is known, that problem is from this contest if and only if its name contains one of Alex's friends' name exactly once. His friends' names are "Danil", "Olya", "Slava", "Ann" and "Nikita".Names are case sensitive.

Input format: The only line contains string from lowercase and uppercase letters and "_" symbols of length, not more than 100 — the name of the problem.

Output format: Print "YES", if problem is from this contest, and "NO" otherwise.

[self-reflection]:
----------------------------------------------

Self reflection output: The provided code does not work correctly because it incorrectly checks for the presence of any of the friend's names in the input string `s`. The code iterates through the string and checks for substrings that match any of the names, incrementing `res` each time a match is found. However, the condition `res == 1` is used to determine if the problem is from the contest, which is incorrect because it does not ensure that each friend's name appears exactly once in the string. Additionally, the code does not handle the case where no names are found or more than one name is found, which would also lead to an incorrect result.

You are an AI Ruby programming language assistant. You will be given incorrect user function implementation and a hint to change the implementation appropriately. Write your full implementation in Ruby.
Use a Ruby programming language code block to write your response. For example:
```ruby
puts 'Hello world!'
```

Example 1:
[incorrect user impl]:
```ruby
x,y=gets.split.map(&:to_i)
if x > 0 and y > 0
    puts "0 #{x+y} #{x+y} 0"
elsif x > 0 and y < 0
    puts "0 #{x-y} #{x-y} 0"
elsif y > 0
    puts "#{-(y-x)} 0 0 #{y-x}"
else
    puts "#{x+y} 0 0 #{x+y}"
end

```

Problem description: Vasily the bear has a favorite rectangle, it has one vertex at point (0, 0), and the opposite vertex at point (x, y). Of course, the sides of Vasya's favorite rectangle are parallel to the coordinate axes. Vasya also loves triangles, if the triangles have one vertex at point B = (0, 0). That's why today he asks you to find two points A = (x1, y1) and C = (x2, y2), such that the following conditions hold:  the coordinates of points: x1, x2, y1, y2 are integers. Besides, the following inequation holds: x1 &lt; x2;  the triangle formed by point A, B and C is rectangular and isosceles ( is right);  all points of the favorite rectangle are located inside or on the border of triangle ABC;  the area of triangle ABC is as small as possible. Help the bear, find the required points. It is not so hard to proof that these points are unique.
Input format: The first line contains two integers x, y ( - 109 ≤ x, y ≤ 109, x ≠ 0, y ≠ 0).
Output format: Print in the single line four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 — the coordinates of the required points.
A pre-run execution outcome of buggy source code: WRONG_ANSWER (The code compiles and runs but does not produce the correct output.)

[self-reflection]:
The provided code does not work correctly because it incorrectly calculates the coordinates for points A, B, and C based on the input values of x and y. The code attempts to determine the coordinates of points A and C based on the conditions for a right-isosceles triangle with one vertex at the origin (0,0), but it fails to correctly compute the coordinates for A and C. Additionally, the conditions for the area of the triangle and the placement of the rectangle inside the triangle are not properly handled in the code.

[improved impl]:
```ruby
x, y = gets.split.map(&:to_i)

if x > 0 && y > 0
  # First quadrant: both positive.
  L = x + y
  puts "0 #{L} #{L} 0"
elsif x > 0 && y < 0
  # Fourth quadrant: x positive, y negative.
  L = x - y  # y is negative, so L is positive.
  puts "0 #{-L} #{L} 0"
elsif x < 0 && y > 0
  # Second quadrant: x negative, y positive.
  L = y - x  # x is negative, so L is positive.
  puts "#{-L} 0 0 #{L}"
else
  # Third quadrant: both negative.
  # Here, x+y is negative; it serves as the leg length (with proper sign).
  puts "#{x+y} 0 0 #{x+y}"
end

Problem description: One day Alex was creating a contest about his friends, but accidentally deleted it. Fortunately, all the problems were saved, but now he needs to find them among other problems.But there are too many problems, to do it manually. Alex asks you to write a program, which will determine if a problem is from this contest by its name.It is known, that problem is from this contest if and only if its name contains one of Alex's friends' name exactly once. His friends' names are "Danil", "Olya", "Slava", "Ann" and "Nikita".Names are case sensitive.

Input format: The only line contains string from lowercase and uppercase letters and "_" symbols of length, not more than 100 — the name of the problem.

Output format: Print "YES", if problem is from this contest, and "NO" otherwise.

A pre-run execution outcome of buggy source code: WRONG_ANSWER (The code compiles and runs but does not produce the correct output.)
        

[reflection on previous impl]:
The provided code does not work correctly because it incorrectly checks if the problem name contains any of the friend's names exactly once. The current implementation uses `!!s[x]` to check for the presence of a friend's name, which is unnecessary and incorrect for the purpose of checking if a name appears exactly once. The `one?` method should be used with a block that directly checks if the substring matches any of the friend's names and ensures that it appears exactly once in the problem name. The current implementation does not properly filter out the cases where a name appears more than once or not at all.

Problem description: You've got a 5 × 5 matrix, consisting of 24 zeroes and a single number one. Let's index the matrix rows by numbers from 1 to 5 from top to bottom, let's index the matrix columns by numbers from 1 to 5 from left to right. In one move, you are allowed to apply one of the two following transformations to the matrix:  Swap two neighboring matrix rows, that is, rows with indexes i and i + 1 for some integer i (1 ≤ i &lt; 5).  Swap two neighboring matrix columns, that is, columns with indexes j and j + 1 for some integer j (1 ≤ j &lt; 5). You think that a matrix looks beautiful, if the single number one of the matrix is located in its middle (in the cell that is on the intersection of the third row and the third column). Count the minimum number of moves needed to make the matrix beautiful.

Input format: The input consists of five lines, each line contains five integers: the j-th integer in the i-th line of the input represents the element of the matrix that is located on the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column. It is guaranteed that the matrix consists of 24 zeroes and a single number one.

Output format: Print a single integer — the minimum number of moves needed to make the matrix beautiful.

Self reflection output: The provided code does not work correctly because it incorrectly calculates the minimum number of moves needed to make the matrix beautiful. The code attempts to find the position of the number one in the matrix by using `find_index`, which is not appropriate for this task. Instead, it should iterate through the matrix to find the position of the number one and then calculate the minimum number of moves required to bring it to the center. The current implementation does not handle the matrix traversal or the calculation of moves correctly.

Problem description: Vasily the bear has a favorite rectangle, it has one vertex at point (0, 0), and the opposite vertex at point (x, y). Of course, the sides of Vasya's favorite rectangle are parallel to the coordinate axes. Vasya also loves triangles, if the triangles have one vertex at point B = (0, 0). That's why today he asks you to find two points A = (x1, y1) and C = (x2, y2), such that the following conditions hold:  the coordinates of points: x1, x2, y1, y2 are integers. Besides, the following inequation holds: x1 &lt; x2;  the triangle formed by point A, B and C is rectangular and isosceles ( is right);  all points of the favorite rectangle are located inside or on the border of triangle ABC;  the area of triangle ABC is as small as possible. Help the bear, find the required points. It is not so hard to proof that these points are unique.

Input format: The first line contains two integers x, y ( - 109 ≤ x, y ≤ 109, x ≠ 0, y ≠ 0).

Output format: Print in the single line four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 — the coordinates of the required points.

[reflection on previous impl]:
The provided code does not work correctly because it incorrectly calculates the minimum number of moves needed to make the matrix beautiful. The code attempts to find the position of the number one in the matrix by using `find_index`, which is not appropriate for this task. Instead, it should iterate through the matrix to find the position of the number one and then calculate the minimum number of moves required to bring it to the center. The current implementation does not handle the matrix traversal or the calculation of moves correctly.

You are a helpful Ruby programming assistant. You are helping a user debug a Ruby program. The user has written some code, but it has errors. You will help the user by analyzing the following information:
The buggy source code provided.
The problem description, which explains the intended behavior of the program.
The input format, which describes the structure, range, and constraints of inputs.
The expected output format, which specifies how the program's output should be structured.
The pre-run execution outcome, which describes how the buggy code currently behaves.
Based on this information, explain why the provided code does not work correctly in a concise natural language response. Focus only on describing the issue and do not suggest or generate a corrected implementation.
Your response should be a short explanation (2-3 sentences) of what is wrong. Do not include code in your response.

Examples:
[incorrect user impl]:
```ruby
x,y=gets.split.map(&:to_i)
if x > 0 and y > 0

Problem description: Vasily the bear has a favorite rectangle, it has one vertex at point (0, 0), and the opposite vertex at point (x, y). Of course, the sides of Vasya's favorite rectangle are parallel to the coordinate axes. Vasya also loves triangles, if the triangles have one vertex at point B = (0, 0). That's why today he asks you to find two points A = (x1, y1) and C = (x2, y2), such that the following conditions hold:  the coordinates of points: x1, x2, y1, y2 are integers. Besides, the following inequation holds: x1 &lt; x2;  the triangle formed by point A, B and C is rectangular and isosceles ( is right);  all points of the favorite rectangle are located inside or on the border of triangle ABC;  the area of triangle ABC is as small as possible. Help the bear, find the required points. It is not so hard to proof that these points are unique.
Input format: The first line contains two integers x, y ( - 109 ≤ x, y ≤ 109, x ≠ 0, y ≠ 0).
Output format: Print in the single line four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 — the coordinates of the required points.
A pre-run execution outcome of buggy source code: WRONG_ANSWER (The code compiles and runs but does not produce the correct output.)

[self-reflection]:
The provided code does not work correctly because it incorrectly calculates the coordinates for points A, B, and C based on the input values of x and y. The code attempts to determine the coordinates of points A and C based on the conditions for a right-isosceles triangle with one vertex at the origin (0,0), but it fails to correctly compute the coordinates for A and C. Additionally, the conditions for the area of the triangle and the placement of the rectangle inside the triangle are not properly handled in the code.

Problem description: You've got a 5 × 5 matrix, consisting of 24 zeroes and a single number one. Let's index the matrix rows by numbers from 1 to 5 from top to bottom, let's index the matrix columns by numbers from 1 to 5 from left to right. In one move, you are allowed to apply one of the two following transformations to the matrix:  Swap two neighboring matrix rows, that is, rows with indexes i and i + 1 for some integer i (1 ≤ i &lt; 5).  Swap two neighboring matrix columns, that is, columns with indexes j and j + 1 for some integer j (1 ≤ j &lt; 5). You think that a matrix looks beautiful, if the single number one of the matrix is located in its middle (in the cell that is on the intersection of the third row and the third column). Count the minimum number of moves needed to make the matrix beautiful.

Input format: The input consists of five lines, each line contains five integers: the j-th integer in the i-th line of the input represents the element of the matrix that is located on the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column. It is guaranteed that the matrix consists of 24 zeroes and a single number one.

Output format: Print a single integer — the minimum number of moves needed to make the matrix beautiful.

[reflection on previous impl]: The error occurs because in the case where x is positive and y is negative, the implementation calculates the coordinate using x - y, which produces a positive value. However, the expected output requires the y-coordinate of one triangle vertex to be negative so that the triangle properly encloses the rectangle. In short, the sign for the y-coordinate is handled incorrectly in this quadrant.

Assistant: The implementation is wrong because it incorrectly calculates the minimum number of moves to bring the number 1 to the center of the matrix. The current implementation only considers the row and column indices of the number 1 and calculates the Manhattan distance to the center of the matrix (which is at position (2, 2)). This approach does not account for the specific positions of the number 1 in the matrix, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, the implementation should directly calculate the minimum number of moves required to bring the number 1 to the center of the matrix by considering the current position of the number 1 and the desired center position (2, 2). The correct calculation should take into account the absolute differences between the current row and column indices and the desired center indices.

[reflection on previous impl]: The error occurs because in the case where x is positive and y is negative, the implementation calculates the coordinate using x - y, which produces a positive value. However, the expected output requires the y-coordinate of one triangle vertex to be negative so that the triangle properly encloses the rectangle. In short, the sign for the y-coordinate is handled incorrectly in this quadrant.

[improved impl]:
```ruby
x, y = gets.split.map(&:to_i)

if x > 0 && y > 0
  # First quadrant: both positive.
  L = x + y
  puts "0 #{L} #{L} 0"
elsif x > 0 && y < 0
  # Fourth quadrant: x positive, y negative.
  L = x - y  # y is negative, so L is positive.
  puts "0 #{-L} #{L} 0"
elsif x < 0 && y > 0
  # Second quadrant: x negative, y positive.
  L = y - x  # x is negative, so L is positive.

else
  # Third quadrant: both negative.
  # Here, x+y is negative; it serves as the leg length (with proper sign).

Problem description: You've got a 5 × 5 matrix, consisting of 24 zeroes and a single number one. Let's index the matrix rows by numbers from 1 to 5 from top to bottom, let's index the matrix columns by numbers from 1 to 5 from left to right. In one move, you are allowed to apply one of the two following transformations to the matrix:  Swap two neighboring matrix rows, that is, rows with indexes i and i + 1 for some integer i (1 ≤ i &lt; 5).  Swap two neighboring matrix columns, that is, columns with indexes j and j + 1 for some integer j (1 ≤ j &lt; 5). You think that a matrix looks beautiful, if the single number one of the matrix is located in its middle (in the cell that is on the intersection of the third row and the third column). Count the minimum number of moves needed to make the matrix beautiful.

Input format: The input consists of five lines, each line contains five integers: the j-th integer in the i-th line of the input represents the element of the matrix that is located on the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column. It is guaranteed that the matrix consists of 24 zeroes and a single number one.

Output format: Print a single integer — the minimum number of moves needed to make the matrix beautiful.

A pre-run execution outcome of buggy source code: RUNTIME_ERROR (The code compiles successfully but encounters an error during execution, such as division by zero or assertion failures.)

Assistant: The implementation is wrong because it incorrectly calculates the minimum number of moves to bring the number 1 to the center of the matrix. The current implementation only considers the row and column indices of the number 1 and calculates the Manhattan distance to the center of the matrix (which is at position (2, 2)). This approach does not account for the specific positions of the number 1 in the matrix, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, the implementation should directly calculate the minimum number of moves required to bring the number 1 to the center of the matrix by considering the current position of the number 1 and the desired center position (2, 2). The correct calculation should take into account the absolute differences between the current row and column indices and the desired center indices.

That's why today he asks you to find two points A = (x1, y1) and C = (x2, y2), such that the following conditions hold:  the coordinates of points: x1, x2, y1, y2 are integers. Besides, the following inequation holds: x1 &lt; x2;  the triangle formed by point A, B and C is rectangular and isosceles ( is right);  all points of the favorite rectangle are located inside or on the border of triangle ABC;  the area of triangle ABC is as small as possible. Help the bear, find the required points. It is not so hard to proof that these points are unique.
Input format: The first line contains two integers x, y ( - 109 ≤ x, y ≤ 109, x ≠ 0, y ≠ 0).

Self reflection output: The provided code does not work correctly because it incorrectly iterates over the matrix and calculates the distance to the position of the number one. The code uses a block with `1..5`, which is incorrect for iterating over lines in the input. Instead, it should use `each_with_index` to get both the value and the index of each element in the matrix. Additionally, the calculation of the Manhattan distance to the center of the matrix is based on incorrect indexing, as it subtracts 3 from the row and column indices, which is not the correct way to find the center of a 5x5 matrix.

You are a helpful Ruby programming assistant. You are helping a user debug a Ruby program. The user has written some code, but it has errors. You will help the user by analyzing the following information:
The buggy source code provided.
The problem description, which explains the intended behavior of the program.
The input format, which describes the structure, range, and constraints of inputs.
The expected output format, which specifies how the program's output should be structured.
The pre-run execution outcome, which describes how the buggy code currently behaves.
Based on this information, explain why the provided code does not work correctly in a concise natural language response. Focus only on describing the issue and do not suggest or generate a corrected implementation.
Your response should be a short explanation (2-3 sentences) of what is wrong. Do not include code in your response.

Examples:
[incorrect user impl]:
```ruby
x,y=gets.split.map(&:to_i)
if x > 0 and y > 0

Problem description: Vasily the bear has a favorite rectangle, it has one vertex at point (0, 0), and the opposite vertex at point (x, y). Of course, the sides of Vasya's favorite rectangle are parallel to the coordinate axes. Vasya also loves triangles, if the triangles have one vertex at point B = (0, 0). That's why today he asks you to find two points A = (x1, y1) and C = (x2, y2), such that the following conditions hold:  the coordinates of points: x1, x2, y1, y2 are integers. Besides, the following inequation holds: x1 &lt; x2;  the triangle formed by point A, B and C is rectangular and isosceles ( is right);  all points of the favorite rectangle are located inside or on the border of triangle ABC;  the area of triangle ABC is as small as possible. Help the bear, find the required points. It is not so hard to proof that these points are unique.
Input format: The first line contains two integers x, y ( - 109 ≤ x, y ≤ 109, x ≠ 0, y ≠ 0).
Output format: Print in the single line four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 — the coordinates of the required points.
A pre-run execution outcome of buggy source code: WRONG_ANSWER (The code compiles and runs but does not produce the correct output.)

[self-reflection]:
The provided code does not work correctly because it incorrectly calculates the coordinates for points A, B, and C based on the input values of x and y. The code attempts to determine the coordinates of points A and C based on the conditions for a right-isosceles triangle with one vertex at the origin (0,0), but it fails to correctly compute the coordinates for A and C. Additionally, the conditions for the area of the triangle and the placement of the rectangle inside the triangle are not properly handled in the code.

Self reflection output: The provided code does not work correctly because it incorrectly calculates the minimum number of moves required to place all the pieces in the cells of the same color. The code attempts to minimize the total distance moved by each piece, but it fails to correctly determine the optimal placement based on the color of the cells. Specifically, the code uses incorrect formulas for `dp` and `dq`, which leads to incorrect calculations of the total moves required for each color. Additionally, the comparison between `p` and `q` to determine the minimum number of moves is flawed, as it does not correctly account for the optimal distribution of pieces based on the color of the cells.

Wanting to join the craze, she has immediately bought the strange contraption.Spinners in Sweetland have the form of V-shaped pieces of caramel. Each spinner can, well, spin around an invisible magic axis. At a specific point in time, a spinner can take 4 positions shown below (each one rotated 90 degrees relative to the previous, with the fourth one followed by the first one):  After the spinner was spun, it starts its rotation, which is described by a following algorithm: the spinner maintains its position for a second then majestically switches to the next position in clockwise or counter-clockwise order, depending on the direction the spinner was spun in.Slastyona managed to have spinner rotating for exactly n seconds. Being fascinated by elegance of the process, she completely forgot the direction the spinner was spun in! Lucky for her, she managed to recall the starting position, and wants to deduct the direction given the information she knows. Help her do this.

Input format: There are two characters in the first string – the starting and the ending position of a spinner. The position is encoded with one of the following characters: v (ASCII code 118, lowercase v), &lt; (ASCII code 60), ^ (ASCII code 94) or &gt; (ASCII code 62) (see the picture above for reference). Characters are separated by a single space. In the second strings, a single number n is given (0 ≤ n ≤ 109) – the duration of the rotation. It is guaranteed that the ending position of a spinner is a result of a n second spin in any of the directions, assuming the given starting position.

Self reflection output: The provided code does not work correctly because it incorrectly calculates the direction of rotation based on the starting and ending positions of the spinner. The code attempts to determine the direction by checking if the spinner's position after a certain number of spins matches the ending position, but it fails to correctly handle the circular nature of the spinner's positions (v, <, ^, >). Specifically, the code does not account for the wrap-around behavior of the spinner's positions, leading to incorrect results.

Problem description: Vasily the bear has a favorite rectangle, it has one vertex at point (0, 0), and the opposite vertex at point (x, y). Of course, the sides of Vasya's favorite rectangle are parallel to the coordinate axes. Vasya also loves triangles, if the triangles have one vertex at point B = (0, 0). That's why today he asks you to find two points A = (x1, y1) and C = (x2, y2), such that the following conditions hold:  the coordinates of points: x1, x2, y1, y2 are integers. Besides, the following inequation holds: x1 &lt; x2;  the triangle formed by point A, B and C is rectangular and isosceles ( is right);  all points of the favorite rectangle are located inside or on the border of triangle ABC;  the area of triangle ABC is as small as possible. Help the bear, find the required points. It is not so hard to proof that these points are unique.
Input format: The first line contains two integers x, y ( - 109 ≤ x, y ≤ 109, x ≠ 0, y ≠ 0).
Output format: Print in the single line four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 — the coordinates of the required points.
A pre-run execution outcome of buggy source code: WRONG_ANSWER (The code compiles and runs but does not produce the correct output.)

[self-reflection]:
The provided code does not work correctly because it incorrectly calculates the coordinates for points A, B, and C based on the input values of x and y. The code attempts to determine the coordinates of points A and C based on the conditions for a right-isosceles triangle with one vertex at the origin (0,0), but it fails to correctly compute the coordinates for A and C. Additionally, the conditions for the area of the triangle and the placement of the rectangle inside the triangle are not properly handled in the code.

Problem description:   Walking through the streets of Marshmallow City, Slastyona have spotted some merchants selling a kind of useless toy which is very popular nowadays – caramel spinner! Wanting to join the craze, she has immediately bought the strange contraption.Spinners in Sweetland have the form of V-shaped pieces of caramel. Each spinner can, well, spin around an invisible magic axis. At a specific point in time, a spinner can take 4 positions shown below (each one rotated 90 degrees relative to the previous, with the fourth one followed by the first one):  After the spinner was spun, it starts its rotation, which is described by a following algorithm: the spinner maintains its position for a second then majestically switches to the next position in clockwise or counter-clockwise order, depending on the direction the spinner was spun in.Slastyona managed to have spinner rotating for exactly n seconds. Being fascinated by elegance of the process, she completely forgot the direction the spinner was spun in! Lucky for her, she managed to recall the starting position, and wants to deduct the direction given the information she knows. Help her do this.

Input format: There are two characters in the first string – the starting and the ending position of a spinner. The position is encoded with one of the following characters: v (ASCII code 118, lowercase v), &lt; (ASCII code 60), ^ (ASCII code 94) or &gt; (ASCII code 62) (see the picture above for reference). Characters are separated by a single space. In the second strings, a single number n is given (0 ≤ n ≤ 109) – the duration of the rotation. It is guaranteed that the ending position of a spinner is a result of a n second spin in any of the directions, assuming the given starting position.

Output format: Output cw, if the direction is clockwise, ccw – if counter-clockwise, and undefined otherwise.

[reflection on previous impl]:
The provided code does not work correctly because it incorrectly calculates the direction of rotation based on the starting and ending positions of the spinner. The code attempts to determine the direction by checking if the spinner's position after a certain number of spins matches the ending position, but it fails to correctly handle the circular nature of the spinner's positions (v, <, ^, >). Specifically, the code does not account for the wrap-around behavior of the spinner's positions, leading to incorrect results.
